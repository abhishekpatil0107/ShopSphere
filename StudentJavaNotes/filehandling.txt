*File handling in Java is defined as reading and writing data to a file. The particular file class from the
 package called java.io allows us to handle and work with different formats of files.FileHandling  means 
through our programm we can open a pertivuler hard disk file in which get stored permanantly on the hard disk
to perform diff file operation,different classes exist in java.io.* package.

*How to create object of file class:-
Syntax:-
File f1=new File("c:\\testdata\\t1.txt");
or
File f1=new("c:\\testdata\\t1.txt");
or
File f1=new File("c:\\testdoc");
File f2=new File(f1,"t1.txt");

mkDirs(),renameTo(file dest):
String getName():

In java there are Three types of streams are exist,
i>Bytestream:-
Bytestream:-We use FileInputSream(Read file data)  & FileOutputStream(Write file data)---->used when we work with real data,image,link and also 
hypertextformat,means data class object format--Low level data.binary--0,1 or digit form--numeric Byte
 streams are used to process raw data like binary files. If we have a file that contains binary data, 
then it will be appropriate to use Byte stream. They can be used to read/write data of 8-bit-1 byte. 
Example- Byte streams are used to read or write binary data.-->8 bit=1 bytes
Methods:-
read ()	Used for reading a single character.
readLine()	Reads one complete line.
close()	It closes the input stream.

ii>CharacterStream:-
The character stream uses the byte stream to perform the physical I/O, while
the character stream handles translation between characters and bytes. FileReader,
for example, uses FileInputStream , while FileWriter uses FileOutputStream .
with the help of this stream we perform the operation on the file.
CharacterStream classes are used to work with 16-bit Unicode characters. They can 
perform operations on characters, char arrays and Strings. However, the CharacterStream
classes are mainly used to read characters from the source and write them to the
destination.
CharactorStrem:-FileReader(Read file data) & FileWriter(Write file data).
*Methods:-
FileWriter():
write(): writes a single character to the writer from the file.
write(char[] array): writes the characters from the specified array to the writer.
write(String data): writes the specified string to the writer.
close() : To close the file writer, we can use the close() method.

FileReader():
while((i=fr.read())!=-1)

iii>BufferReader:-
 BufferReader is a Java class used to read characters, arrays, and lines from an
input stream. It is similar to a FileReader but provides buffering functionality as
well. You can take advantage of BufferedReader to read data from files, terminals, 
and other sources.

Methods:-
read ()	Used for reading a single character.
readLine()	Reads one complete line.
close()	It closes the input stream.

*DataInputStream & DataOupstream Class:-
Using this class we can read & write any primitive type of values.
@DataOutputStream:-
-writeInt(int)
-writeDouble(double)
-writeUTF(String)//non primitive data type--UTF

@DataInputStream:-
-readInt()
-readDouble()
-readUTF

UTF:=UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding standard used for electronic 
communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode 
Transformation Format – 8-bit. UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid 
character code points in Unicode using one to four one-byte code units.


*Serialization Of Object:-
To write a state of an object on the outputStream using ObjectOutput class is known
as Serialization of object & read state of an object from IntputStream but in serialization 
use ObjectInputStream is known as Deserialization.
      The class whos object we want to read & write must implemennted Serialization 
Interface which dont have any members. ObjectOutputStream class is used to write the 
object & ObjectInputStream claass is used to read the object.
