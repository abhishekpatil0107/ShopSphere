*CommandLine Argument:-
Command Line Argument means input given by the user at runtime of programm,means user can put any value at runtime is
called as commandline arguments.

*Prime Number:=Means Number divided by one or itself that number we can say its prime number..
*Factorial Number:=5!=5*4*3*2*1 
                    =20*3*2*1
                   5!=120

*Fibbonesis Series:=Means we can take any number and do the addition of 0&1 then add privious number
into next number till we got that number who we taken.First four digit of fibonessis series of any number is 0,1,1,2.. 


*Palindrom Number:Means a number we can read from any direction like left,right after that we got same number that 
number we can say palindrom number.
ex: 121,545,878,111 etc like this type of number we can say its palindron number..

*Armstrong Number:Means we take the number each Digits of cube Sum(Addition)finding after that we got the same number
that number we can say armstrong number..
ex:153 it is armstrong number.
153=1*1*1+5*5*5+3*3*3
   =1+125+27
   =28+125
   =153       370=3*3*3+7*7*7+0*0*0
                  27+343+0
                  370+0
                  =370


*Scanner:-Is used when we want to put value on Console and read the output from console,simply user give input or write
i/p on console and read output from console that time we can used scanner.Scanner is predefine class in java who exist
in java.util.*;package,its predefine package.

*Syntax of Scanner is,
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
sc-is a object of scanner class here,System is also predefine class who exist java.lang.Obj is bydefault package exist
&in means input.&new is a keyword here.
java.lang.obj; is a bydefault package no need to import this package when we create java class that time its automati
cally import,without this package we cant write single line programm in java.

Methods of scanner class below,
sc.next():-Read the next complete word from the input.
sc.nextLine():-Read the next entire line of i/p untill the end of the line.
sc.nextInt():-Read the i/p as an integer.
sc.nextDouble():-Read the i/p as an double
sc.nextBoolean():-Read the i/p as an boolean(true/false).
sc.hasNext():-check if there is another token is available.
sc.close():-Close the scanner and release the resourse.
