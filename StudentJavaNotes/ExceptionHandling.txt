*Exception Handling:- 
Exception means runtime error or logical error,when exception occure in the java programm
then JVM first detect that exception,and create the object of perticuler exception class.
which print some error message on the screen then programm will get terminate at that
 time.
        Exception may occure in some following conditions,
i]if we are trying to divide by zero. 
ii]if object is created,but memory is not allowcated of that objects.
iii]if we are assign wrong type of value to integer type variable. 
  Exception:- is the predefine class in java which inherited from throwable class.
 1]Checked Exception:-     
 2]Unchecked Exception:-
 #Error:-Is the sub type of unchecked exception.
  i]CompileTime Error:-it means synthatical error like bracket,semicolan missing in    
  the programm,
  ii]RunTimeError:-it means logical error.

1]Checked Exception:-The classes is directally inherit from exceptional class,which
 are checked at compile time.compiler force to handle that exception at compile time.
ex:-IOException,SQLException.

2]Unchecked Exception:-The classes are inherit at runtime exception,which is inherited 
from exception,which is not checked at compile time,compliler doesnt force to handle
 that exception,so this exception can handle different exceptional situvations.a 
 diff predefine classes are there.below are the example of unchecked exception here,
i]ArithmaticException:-
It Occure when problem is there in arithmatic statements like divide by zero.
ex:= If we divide any number by zero, there occurs an ArithmeticException.
int a=50/0;//ArithmeticException..
  
ii]NumberFormatException/InputMismatchException:-
 It occure when a wrong type of value assign to the integer type of variable.
eg:=String s="abc";  
int i=Integer.parseInt(s);//NumberFormatException  

iii]NullPointerException:-
It Occure when object is declaire but memory is not allowcated to that object.
ex:2)String s=null;  
System.out.println(s.length());//NullPointerException  

iv]ArrayIndexOutofBoundException:-
   when we access the array element which is exceeds the array size.
eg:=int a[]=new int[5];  
a[10]=50; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  

v]IOException/FileNotFoundException:- 
 It generate when error is there in I/O Operation.

       Excption Handling means if exception occures handle that exception and the 
remaining programm exicution must be continue,to handle the exception following
 keywords are used.
i>try ii>catch iii>throw  iv>throws v>finally

>>TryBlock:-   It contain those statement in which it is the possiblity of an exception 
is occure & statement depends on that exception statements.

>>CatchBlock:- When exception is generate in try block,control is passed to the catch block.
catch block must be immediatally after the try block.catch block is the exception handler block
which handle the exception genereted in try block.

Try and Catch block is called as Predefine block..
Syntax:-try
        {-----;//We build logic here.
         -----;
        }
        catch(Exception e)  
        {
         -----;//Exception Handler Block
         -----;
        }

*Multiple catch block for one try block:-
If there are multiple exception possiblities in one try block then to handle them 
seperetally,we can writre a multiple catch block for one try block.

@Keyword Description
try:=	
    The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception 
code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either
 catch or finally.
catch:=
	The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block 
which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.
finally:=
	The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. 
It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
throw:=
	The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
throws:=	
    The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may 
occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used 
with method signature.

*Throw:-Throw keyword is used to throw and generate user define exception,in that 
case first we have to write one user define exception class and that class must 
implement or inherit from exceptional class.it's used to create explicitlt object 
means programmer manually create exceptional class object.in throw exception programm
er responsible to create exception object,throw keyword is used with the method and 
we can say its unchecked exception.

*Throws:-If any methods is able to raise that exception,but if that exception is not
 handled in that method,if its handle calling method then list of possible exception,
we have to mentioned in front of the method name using throws keyword then that exception
get handle in calling method.

*Finally Block:-It contain those statements which must get exicuted whether exception
 raise or whether the exception handle or not.it contain the crutial statements regar
 dless of exception occures,or not. 
        Finally block comes after the catch block but it may comes after try block 
 also then there will be no catch block is exist.In finally block must exicuted after
 try block without going to catch,throw and throws block.
