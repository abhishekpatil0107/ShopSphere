*Inheritance:-(Reuseability):-
Means Creating a new class from existing class or old one.then all the properties of
existing class get transfer into new class,existing class is known as super class,and new class is known
 as sub class.by using inheritance we can reused the code.
There are 5 types of Inheritance but in java only support single,multilevel and hierachical inheritance.

1]Single Inheritance:-In which one class can inherit from only one parent class.
Syntax:-class A //Super class,existing class-->old class,parent class--base class
       {
 
       }
       class B extends A //sub class,new class-->child class--derived class
       {

       }

2]Multilevel Inheritance:-In one class can inherit from a derived class,hence derived class becomes the
base class for new created class are there.

Syntax:- Class A //super class or Base class
         {
         }
         class B extends A //sub class or derived cls
         {
         } 
         class c extends B //sub class
         {
         }
   

3]Hierachical Inheritance:-In Hierachical Inheritance one class  is inherite by many sub classes.Inherit
ance which contain only one super class & Multiple sub classes directaly extends superclass called Hiera
chical Inheritance.it represent like tree or we can say family chart.

Syntax:-class A  //Super class--base class--parent class
       {
       }
       class B extends A //sub class--derived class--child class
       {
       }
       class C extends A //sub class--derived class--child class
       {
       }

4]Multiple Inheritance:-Where one classes extending  more than one class,means it has two superclass nd
one sub class exist thats why java doesn't support it.
Syntax:-class A //super cls --parent cls
        {
        }
        class B //super class --parent cls
        {
        }
        class c extends B,A //clas c is Sub class.
        {
        } 
5]Hybrid Iheritance:-In java Which Combination of Single and Multiple Inheritance.or we can say its 
cyclic ingeritance.
  Syntax:-class A //Super class
          {
          }
          class B extends A //sub class & super cls for c
          {
          }
          class D extends A //sub class
          {
          }
          class C extends B,D //sub class
          {
          }

*Why Multiple Inheritance not support in java:-
-The Reason Behind it this is prevent ambiguty.
-Consider a case Where class B extends class A and Class C extends both class A and B.so both have same
 method display(),then java compiler can't decide,which display method should be called inheritance so 
prevent this type situvation,multiple inheritance not allowed in java.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@Method overloading-:means same name of method with different parameter in one class. 

*Method Oveeriding:-[means same name of method with same parameter between two
 classes].

 Means any superclass methods again written in to sub class with same name and same
 parameter.and if we call that method using sub class object then sub class method 
get's called first.
         If that method is not exist in sub class then superclass method gets called 
means sub class method overrides the super class method,to call the superclass members
 in sub class members in super class using super keyword.
