Final Keyword:-
Final is keywork who is constant,it contain hier key--error,if we will try to create class,
ovveride method and redeclair variable so it generate error,cause its final
@final Class: 
is keyword who constant means no one can changed it that things we can say its final. if we taking a class as final that time we unable
to create new class from that final class,cause it contain hier key means it generate error.
Syntax:final class
final class A
{

}
class B extends A //generate error why cause A is final class.
{

}
@Final Method:
Suppose if we take any super class method as final then we are unable to oveeride
this method in to sub class ,cause its method is final.
Syntax final method.
class Abc
{
  final void show()
{
Sysout("This is a Abc class")
}
}
class xyz extends Abc
{
  @Override
  public void show()//error super clss mtd is final
{
  System.out.println("This is xyz class ")
}

}
@Final Variable:
suppose if we declaire any variable as final then we are unable to rewrite that 
variable or store another value in that variable,cause the variable is final..
Syntax final variable:-
class AA
{
   final int A=10;
  public void show()
{
   A=10;// generate error
}

#Packages:-#
A packages arrenge no.of classes,interfaces,and sub packages of same type into a 
perticuler group.
@Note:-Package is nothing but folder on windows.
Packages Types:
1]Predefine Packages:-The package which is already created by java devloper people
 are called Predefine package.
Ex:-java.lang.Object,java.utill,java.io,java.applet,java.net,java.sql. 
@java.lang:- It is the default package also know as heart of java.because without 
using this package we can't write single programm of java.we don't need to import 
this package.
Ex-System,String,Object,Interface etc.

@java.util:-This package is used to implement data structure of java,it contain utillity classes 
also known as collection framework.
Ex:-Scanner,LinkedList,Stack,Vector,HashSet,Treeset,ArrayList etc.

@java.io:-To stands for input,output this pckg is very useful to perform i/p or o/p 
operation on file.
Ex:-File,FileWriter,FileReader,etc

@java.applet:-This package mainly used to devlop GUI releted application.applet 
programs are web releted programms created at server but exicuted on client machine.
Ex:-Applet.

@java.awt:-Stands for Abstract window Toolkit.it's also used to devlop GUI applicati
on,the only difference between applet & awt programm is,awt programms are standalone 
programm & it contain main.unlike applet.
Ex:-Frame,Button,TextField,etc..

@java.net:-URL,InetAddress,URLConnection and so on.

@java.sql:-Connection,Statements,ResultSet,Class etc..

@javax.swing:-JFrame,JButton,JTextField etc..
javax.swing pckg is platform independant & java.awt is a platform dependant.javax.swi
ng required minimum effort to make a application & javax means extends and extends 
from java.awt package ,this pckg require more effort to make application.

2]UserDefine Packages:-The package created by java programmer or user for their own
choices are called user define package.
Ex:-package p1,package add,package mypack etc.
@Rule:-package statements must be first line of the programm.
    :-The way of compiletion of this classes would be different.
      compile ex:javac -d . java,
      then run ex:clsname.java
      Syntax:package package_name;
      Ex:-package mypack;

-Advantages:-Reuseability,fast searching,Hiding,Naming conflecting ex: p1-A,p2-B.
-Disadvantages:-we can't pass parameter to the package.
