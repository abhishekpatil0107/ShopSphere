*Enhanced For Loop:-
 It is used to iterate or travers in collection of element,it transfer one by one 
 element in to the variable up to the last element.that's Enhanced for loop.
 Syntax:-     Ex int a[]={1,4,6,7,9,3,2,0};                                   
 for(Data type variable name : Element)//for-each loop                                                
 {                                             
                                                   
                                                   
 } 
EX  int a[]={1,4,6,7,9,3,2,0};
 for(int x:a)
{
System.out.print(x);
}
                                              
                                                                                                      
*Autoboxing/Boxing:-Means Conversion of primitive type to object type is known as 
autoboxing because a primitive types of values we can't add in to collection then that
values we have to convert in to object type,so all primitive type has a predefined 
classes are there.which are known as wrapper classes,so conversion from primitive
type to object type is known as Boxing or Autoboxing and conversion from object type 
to primitive type is know as Unboxing.

*Wrapper Classes:-Wrapper classes In java provide the mechanisam is to convert primi
tive type in to object & object into primitive,java is an object oriented programming
language,so we need to deal with objects many times like in serialization,collections
etc.
                In that case we need to use the wrapper classes.so for each primi
tive type has one predefine class is there exist in java.lang.Object package,it is a
predefine package.
 Primitive Types               predefine Class(Wrapper class)
 
 char                              Charactor
 byte                               Byte
 short                             Short
 int                               Integer
 float                             Float
 double                            Double
 long                              Long
boolean                            Boolean

*Variable Length Arguments:-Using Varargs allow the method to accept zero or multiple
arguments before varargs concepts.we have overload method to take multiple argument,
if we dont know how many argument we will have to pass in the method then we can use
varargs concepts.

*Type-safe Enumration:
enum is a data type which contain fix set of constants,it can be used for day's of 
week,directions,seasons,and collections.
