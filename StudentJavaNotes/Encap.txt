@Encapsulation:-
  Encapsulation means enclosing a data or one or more detail from outside the world.
through access the right using acess modifier in java.we can controle a data.
encapsulation access the right to who are eligible or authorable to access the data.
Encapsulation Make the variable private for hide the data from another class or we 
can say another package as well,so that data we can acess with the help of following
 methods are,
   *Getter & Setter Methods:-
Steps:- 
 To generate getter and setter methods-
to generate getter and setter,-right click to the clsassname-->select source-->select
 getter&setter option-->select insertion point-->ok.

*toString Method:-
In java all classes are inherited from object class to string,String is a Predefine
class in java and Nonprimitive data type in java.we can convert the object into string.
when string representation of object address then toString method is come into 
existance. to string method is used to represent the address of string object.
-Steps:-
 right click to the clsassname-->select source-->select tostring option-->insertion 
point-->ok

*Static member variable in that class:-
If we declair the variables as a static  inside the class then only one copy of that
variable gets declaired which is common for all the objects which is shared by all 
the objects.To initiallize static variables we can write a static inside the class 
which gets executed before the main method,to acess the static variables we can write
a static mtd inside the cls..
  In static methods we can access only a static variables & static methods directaly
 we can call using classname.

*passing object as a parameter to method:-
In this type we can pass object as parameter to method so,it's needed to pass class 
name first then object because object is instance of the class.

*Singleton Class:-means A class who's only one instance or object can be created,we 
can't create multiple objects of singleton class.in singleton class a private 
constructor is there and have object of the same class as Static member.
        The class which is allowed us to create any one object is nothing but 
singleton class that  means it restricted the unneccessury creation of an object.
which ever a new request made it user the existing object insteasd of creating new 
object so it saves memory.

@How to create singleton class:-
step1:-Declaire static data member which is instance of singleton class.
step2:-Create private constructor while restrict to create instance of singleton class.
step3:-Create static factory method which allows to create and access the object,and 
it will restrict to create more than one object.

*Advantages Of Singleton Class:-
-It saves memory because it's allow us to create only one object.In java creating 
object is costaly process every time we can create object the memory is allwocated 
in jvm.but in case of singleton class we can create only one object of the class.

*What Is Garbage Collector:-
 In java memory allocation always take place dynamically but no need to deallocate 
that memory at last.because garbage collector are there on JVM,which is external
 programm available on JVM which automatically deallocate the objects,which are out
 of scope,but in your programm if you want to deinnitialize some resources then we 
can ovveride a finalize method which get called Garbage collector.
           In java Garbage means unreferenced objects.Garbage Collector is a process 
of reclaiming  the runtime unused memory automatically,In others words,it's a way to
destroy the unused objects.To do so,we were using free() function in c lang and delete
 in c++,but in java it's performed automatically. so java provides better memory
 management.

@How to Work On Garbage Collection?
The Garbage collector of JVM collets only those objects that are created by new 
keyword,so if you have  created any object without new keyword,you can use finalize 
method to perform clenup processing (Destroying remaining objects).
