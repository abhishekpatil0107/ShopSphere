*String Class:-
String is a Predefine class in java which stores a collection or group of charactors.String stored in the String object
of immutable String means after assigning a value to string object then we can't change that value of the string,
Immutable is simply means unmodiffieble or unchangeble.it is used the less memory.

*How to create object of string class:-
String s1="Hello World"; //1 object
or 
String s1=new String("Hello World");//2 object
or
char ch[]={'H','e','l','l','o','w','o','r','d'};
String s1=new String(ch);

*Methods Of The StringClass:-
i] charAt():-
Return a single charactor of perticuler position of string.
ii] length():-
Return the length of the string.
iii] toUpperCase():-
Convert the String into uppercase.
iv] toLowerCase():-
convert the strings into lowercase.
v] Substring():-It Return the substring from start position upto n postn-1(n-1),
   Ex:-String s1="Hello World";       
       String s2=s1.substring(2,7);    EX  Hello world--Super String 
        o/p:-llo w--substring              012345678910--> index position             
  
vi] Replace():-It Replace Specified Charactor from the string with new charactor
          String s1="Hello World";
          String s2=s1.replace('l','p');
o/p:-Heppo Worpd

vii]IndexOf():-Search a perticuler given charactor or string of first occurance position
ex:1] String s1="Hello World";
System.out.println(s1.IndexOf('o'));
o/p:-4
2] System.out.println(s1.IndexOf('o',5));
o/p:-  o-->7
3] System.out.println(s1.IndexOf("World"));
o/p:-6--->caus W is in 6 th position.

viii] CompareTo():-Compare the two strings and  return zero as string are equal otherwise  it return different ASCII 
Value of first unmatching charactor.
ASCII:stands for American standered code information interchange.
A to Z:- 65 to 90
a to z:- 97 to 122
Special charactor:-0 to 9=48 to 57

String s1="Hello World";
String s2="hello world";
System.out.println(s1.compareTo(s2));
o/p:-32.  A-a (65-97) =-32

*StringBuffer Class:-It is used to create mutable means modifieble string object.
this class is same as string class except it's mutable,it can be changed.this class
 contain Synchronized method.

 How to create stringBuffer Class Object:-
String s1="Hello World";
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer(s1);
System.out.pringtln(sb);

or 
   StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("Hello World");
   System.out.println(sb);        

*StringBuffer Methods:-i]charAt() ii]length() is same as string class
iii)Append()-It is used to add or join the whole string at the end.
         StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("Hello");
         String s1="World";
         System.out.println(sb.append(s1));o/p=HelloWorld
 
iv) Insert():-Insert the new string at specified position.
               StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("This Test");
               sb.insert(5,"is");
              System.out.println(sb); o/p:-This is test

v)Replace():-Replace the specified charactor or string with another string.
vi)Delete():-Delete the string from start position up to n position -1. 
vii)Reverse():-It Reverse the String

*Anagrams String:-Two String are said to be anagram if we can form one string by 
rearrenging the charactor of another string.for ex Race and Care,here 
we can form Race by rearrenging the charactors of Care.
                eg:-LISTEN  dog
                    SILENT  god
*StringBuilder Class:-
StringBuilder class is also mutable means modifieble string,this class
is same as a stringBuffer class except its non sychronized and stringBuffer
contains synchronized methods.Stringbuilder method class is not different is same as
stringBuffer class.

trim():-Trim method of the stringBuilder class initially makes a copy of the current 
String,removes its leading & trailing spaces and return it,you need to convert the 
stringbuilder object using the toString() metod.invoke the trim() method on the 
result.

split("\\"):-split method is used  to split  a string into an array of substring using backslash based on a specified 
delimeter(or reguler expression),this metod is part of string class.here back slash is reguler expression here
here,1-split the string into an array of substring using the backslash as a delimeter.
2-reverse the array of substring
3-join the reverse array back into a single string.

*Difference Between StringBufferclass and StringBuilderClass.
StringBuffer Class                                  StringBuilder Class
i] String Buffer Is Synchronized                i]StringBuilder is nonSynchronized    
that means two thread can't call the               means two thread can call the method 
StringBuffer Simulteneousaly.                   StringBuilder Simulteneousaly.
ii]StringBuffer was introduced to               ii]StringBuilder was introduced to
JDK 1.5                                         java 1.5
iii]StringBuffer is less efficient              iii]StringBuilder is more efficient
 than stringbuilder                                 than stringbufferer.
