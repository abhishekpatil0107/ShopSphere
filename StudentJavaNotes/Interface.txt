@Interface:-
Interface Is Simmilar to an abstract class.which contain to an variables and methods.
but by default all variables in inteface are final,final means constant.and all 
methods are only declaired.after JDK 1.8 a default & static methods are there in 
interface which are defined.
  Interface, we can implements in the class then all methods who are declaired of 
that interface comulsary we have to override in derived classes.we can't create 
object of interface because it's contain  the declaired methods but we can create
 reference variable of interface in which we can stored the reference of implemented
 class object.
Interface are normally used if you want to forcefully implement in the class.we can
implement more than one interface in the class which is simmilar to multiple inherita
nce.but multiple inheritance is a class,so interface is a keyword not a class.it used\
to create another interface.  

@Point Of The Interface:-
-Interface methods are by default public and abstract.
-Interface contain only absrtract methods
-Interface has no body exist.
-Interface variables are by default public static and final.
-Interface method must be ovveriden inside the implementing classes.
-Interface nothing but deal with Between client and devloper.
-we can implement one or more interface & create another class to making more 
interface need implements in the class.
